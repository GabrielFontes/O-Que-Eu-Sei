# Ansible

Ansible is an important tool for me. I'm Sysadmin and my responsibility is orchestration and configure servers.

Why automate?
1. fewer mistakes - Transfer your responsibility for computer, it fewer mistakes.
2. Less time-consuming - live your life while computer toil for you.
3. self-documenting - your work is to analyze the steps
4. Reproducibility

"If a human operator needs to touch your system during normal operations, you have a bug. The definition of normal changes as your systems grow." - Carla Geisser, Google SRE

Ansible Features:
1. Open-Source - If you have some report you can send for the community. If you have some bug, you can fix if nothing one of the other contributor, send before for you
2. Easy management - The knowledge necessary is "yaml" and ansible modules.
3. To use Ansible you only need ssh and python. Don't necessary an Ansible Agent in host that you are setting up.
